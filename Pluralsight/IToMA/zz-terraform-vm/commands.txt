# We're going to launch a Terraform VM into the Security subscription
az account set -s SEC_SUB_NAME

# Follow the standard Terraform process
terraform init

terraform plan -out tfvm.tfplan

terraform apply tfvm.tfplan

# The outputs include the public IP address of the VM and
# the password for the VM. The username is azureuser. 
# Connect via SSH with the username and password
# and then you should be able to follow along with the video

# Be sure to destroy this VM when you're done or at least deallocate the VM to
# save on costs!
