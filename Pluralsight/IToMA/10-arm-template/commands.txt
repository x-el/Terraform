# Next we're going to update the networking config with a subnet delegation
# Upload the 10-arm-template/subnet_delegation.tf file to the networking
# directory in the Azure DevOps Repo

# Adding the file should kick off a pipeline run
# Approve the Production deployment and let the pipeline finish

# Now we've set the stage for deploying the arm template
# Copy the template and template-deploy.tf files over to 9-app-deploy
cp template-deploy.tf ../9-app-deploy/
cp azuredeploy.json ../9-app-deploy/

# Now we'll run the template deploy

terraform plan -out app.tfplan
terraform apply "app.tfplan"

# Rinse and repeat for the other workspaces
