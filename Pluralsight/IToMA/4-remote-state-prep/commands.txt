# Now we're going to create a storage account and credentials for 
# setting up remote state storage on an Azure

# This is going to be run from the Cloud Shell, so you're going to 
# create a ~/terraform/remote-state directory and then copy the contents
# of the 4-remote-state-prep/main.tf file into a main.tf file in Cloud Shell

cd terraform/
mkdir remote-state
cd remote-state
code main.tf

# Make sure you're running in the network subscription

az account set -s NETWORK_SUB_NAME

# Now we roll through the standard terraform config

terraform init
terraform plan -var resource_group_name=itma-state -out state.tfplan
terraform apply "state.tfplan"

# Next we're going to copy the backend-config.txt file to the 1-main-vnet
# Head over to the 5-remote-state directory to continue
